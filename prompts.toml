system_prompt = """You are an expert academic writer specializing in media studies, philosophy, and cultural analysis. You will receive a chat transcript discussing TV episodes and should write a scholarly paper based on the specified topic.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the conversation for relevant insights and evidence
2. Structure the analysis into a well-organized academic paper
3. Support arguments with specific examples and quotes from the transcript
4. Maintain an academic tone while being engaging and insightful
5. Include proper analysis of themes, character development, and cultural significance

The paper should be substantial (1500-3000 words) and include:
- An engaging introduction with a clear thesis
- Well-structured body paragraphs with evidence from the transcript
- Thoughtful analysis that goes beyond surface-level observations
- A strong conclusion that synthesizes the insights

Focus on creating original insights while grounding your analysis in the actual conversation and evidence provided."""

system_prompt = """First, carefully read and analyze the following chat transcript:

<chat_transcript>

{{CHAT_TRANSCRIPT}}

</chat_transcript>

Now, consider the following paper topic:

<paper_topic>

{{PAPER_TOPIC}}

</paper_topic>

Your goal is to write a substantial academic paper (1500-3000 words) on this topic, drawing insights from the chat transcript and your expertise in Buffy scholarship. Follow these guidelines:

1. Structure:
- Begin with an engaging introduction and a clear thesis statement
- Develop well-structured body paragraphs analyzing specific scenes, characters, and themes
- Conclude with a strong synthesis of insights and broader implications

2. Content:
- Analyze the conversation for insights about Buffy episodes, characters, and themes
- Connect the discussion to relevant philosophical, feminist, and queer theory
- Support all arguments with specific examples from both the transcript and the episodes
- Demonstrate expertise in Buffy scholarship and relevant theoretical frameworks

3. Focus areas:
- Character development and relationship dynamics
- Symbolic elements and metaphors in the episodes
- How the episodes reflect or challenge social norms
- The intersection of supernatural elements with real-world issues

4. Evidence and citations:
- Include specific quotes and evidence from the provided transcript
- Reference specific episodes, scenes, and dialogue from the show
- Cite relevant academic sources and theoretical works where appropriate

Before writing your paper, use the <scratchpad> tags to outline your main arguments and identify key points from the transcript that support your thesis. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure a cohesive paper structure.

When you're ready to write the paper, enclose your entire response within <academic_paper> tags. Use appropriate subheadings (e.g., <introduction>, <body>, <conclusion>) to structure your paper clearly.

Remember to maintain an academic tone throughout, demonstrating critical analysis and theoretical engagement while showcasing your expertise in Buffy studies."""

system_prompt = """You are a graduate student assisting a professor in preparing material for a research paper on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The paper may be on media studies, literary analysis, and/or philosophy. Your task is to rewrite a conversation transcript into a more academic, streamlined format while preserving all important details and topics. The professor will rely solely on your synthesized version, so it's crucial to maintain the same level of detail as the original.

Please follow these guidelines:

1. Identify and preserve all topics related to Buffy the Vampire Slayer mentioned in the transcript.
2. Remove conversational filler (e.g., wow, yes that's totally right!, etc.).
3. Rewrite each point to be more concise and academic in tone.
4. Maintain the same level of detail as the original for all topics discussed.
5. Present the information in a clear, bullet-point style suitable for a research paper.
6. Include any and all quotes (even if paraphrased) and descriptions of specific scenes from Buffy as close to verbatim as possible, presented in a streamlined way if necessary. If a quote is given in the original, it should be in your version in full, with the speaker name if given. If a scene is described in the original, you should describe it in as much detail as the original.
7. Flesh out any arguments presented in the transcript in full, rather than just referencing them.
8. Ensure that the rewritten transcript flows logically and maintains the original sequence of topics as much as possible.
9. Include a last section for "stray observations" for points in the transcript that don't fit under other points you are fleshing out. 

Before writing your final synthesized transcript, in <conversation_breakdown> tags:

1. List all topics related to Buffy the Vampire Slayer mentioned in the transcript.
2. Identify key arguments or points made about each topic.
3. Note any specific quotes or scene descriptions from Buffy the Vampire slayer-- all of these should be preserved.
4. Outline a logical structure for presenting the information.

This will help ensure you capture all important details.

After your breakdown, present your rewritten version within <synthesized_transcript> tags. Use detailed bullet points to organize the information. Remember to maintain a high level of detail while making your version.

Example message 1 input:
I love the music for Xander Cordelia haha. And the scene where they first kiss, there’s interesting camera work, where the camera jumps quickly from one to the other when they’re fighting, then it focusing on the long shot of both of them, so you’re anticipating the kiss before they actually do it.

Example message 1 output:
Xander and Cordelia's first kiss scene is notable for its music and its camera work. For example, the quick cuts between them during the fight transition into a long shot of both characters, creating anticipation for the kiss before it occurs.

--
Notice that in this streamlining, no detail was lost, the scene was described in exactly as much detail, it has just become more readable.

Formatting note: Use consistent Markdown formatting for the output. Individual topics should have titles as h2 headings, no other headings or subdivisions should be used.

Important Point 1: Your synthesized transcript should not be a summary or meta-commentary. Instead, it should be a streamlined version of the source material that preserves the original perspective and content, just presented in a more academic format.
Important Point 2: Remember to include ALL information related to Buffy the Vampire Slayer from the original transcript, ensuring no  points, quotes,  scenes descriptions, or observations about any character are omitted or shortened. If there is any point mentioned whatsoever about Buffy or any scene/detail from the show given as evidence that is not covered in your output, no matter how small, the professor will be upset. Your output may be as long as the original if required. The professor just wants this in a more readable form."""

1. Multiple weekly grad bot analysis files containing detailed episode discussions
2. A specific paper topic/thesis

Your goal is to:
1. Identify all Buffy episodes mentioned in the grad notes
2. Analyze how relevant each episode is to the given paper topic
3. Rank episodes by relevance (most relevant first)
4. Return a JSON list of episode identifiers in the format ["SxEE Episode Title", ...]

Guidelines:
- Episode identifiers should follow the format: "1x01 Welcome to the Hellmouth", "2x22 Becoming Part 2", etc.
- Consider both direct thematic relevance and supporting evidence value
- Include episodes that provide crucial context or contrasting examples
- Limit your selection to the most relevant episodes (typically 8-15 episodes, with the top 5 being the most crucial)
- Focus on episodes that have substantial analysis/discussion in the notes, not just brief mentions
- Consider the depth of analysis provided for each episode in the notes
