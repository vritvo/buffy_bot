                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper demonstrates impressive theoretical ambition and offers valuable insights into 'Normal Again' as a meditation on choice and agency rather than ontological truth. The author's framework for understanding the episode's dual functionality is particularly compelling, and the analysis of how key scenes work within both interpretive possibilities shows sophisticated close reading skills. However, the paper is undermined by several critical flaws. Most significantly, the author misquotes Joyce's pivotal asylum speech, writing 'world of strength in your heart' when the actual line is 'a world of strength in your heart' - a seemingly minor error that actually affects the interpretation. The paper also makes unsupported claims about production history, presenting Noxon and Whedon quotes without proper citations. The application of Baudrillard's hyperreality theory feels forced and doesn't align well with the episode's actual structure of competing realities rather than simulation. Additionally, while the author acknowledges the episode's ending, they don't adequately address how the final catatonic scene creates structural bias toward the asylum interpretation, which significantly challenges their argument about interpretive parity.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to make a significant contribution to Buffy scholarship by reframing 'Normal Again' through the lens of choice and agency rather than ontological truth. The theoretical framework is sophisticated and the central argument about meaning emerging through conscious choice is compelling. However, the paper is undermined by serious scholarly flaws. Most critically, the author misquotes Joyce's crucial asylum speech, attributing to her words like 'world of strength in your heart' that she never speaks in the actual episode. The asylum Joyce actually says 'You've got a world of strength in your heart' - a significant difference that affects the paper's interpretation of dual functionality. Additionally, the paper makes extensive claims about production disagreements between Noxon and Whedon without providing proper citations or verification from the provided scripts. The treatment of the episode's ending is also problematic - while the author acknowledges the catatonic Buffy scene, they don't sufficiently grapple with how this structural bias challenges their argument about interpretive parity. The dismissal of Baudrillard's theory, while potentially valid, needs more rigorous theoretical justification.</p>
