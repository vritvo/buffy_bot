                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>This paper presents a sophisticated philosophical analysis of 'Normal Again' that transcends typical binary interpretations by applying Baudrillard's simulation theory and Nietzschean concepts of life affirmation. The argument is well-developed and makes a meaningful contribution to Buffy scholarship.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Strengths</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Excellent theoretical framework combining Baudrillard's hyperreality with Nietzschean life affirmation</li><li>Sophisticated argument that moves beyond simple real/unreal binary to focus on choice and agency</li><li>Strong textual analysis, particularly of Joyce's pivotal speech and its dual functionality</li><li>Effective challenge to Noxon's dismissal of the asylum interpretation</li><li>Well-structured argument that builds logically from simulation theory to existential choice</li><li>Prescient connection to contemporary debates about simulation theory and mental illness</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Some philosophical concepts could benefit from more detailed explanation for general readers</li><li>The meta-textual analysis of the Trio as 'ordinary students' could be developed further</li><li>Occasional overstatement of claims without sufficient textual support</li><li>Could engage more directly with existing Buffy scholarship on this episode</li>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper successfully reframes the critical discourse around 'Normal Again' by demonstrating how the episode's philosophical sophistication lies not in resolving questions of reality but in transcending them. The application of Baudrillard's concept of simulation is particularly effective, showing how both the asylum and Sunnydale function as equally 'real' hyperrealities. The analysis of Joyce's speech as working from both interpretations is insightful and well-supported by the script evidence. The Nietzschean reading of Buffy's choice as amor fati adds depth to the argument about agency and meaning-making. While some philosophical concepts could be explained more accessibly, the overall argument is compelling and advances our understanding of the episode's thematic complexity.</p>

                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>This paper presents a sophisticated philosophical analysis of 'Normal Again' that successfully moves beyond surface-level interpretations to engage with complex questions of reality, simulation, and existential choice. The Baudrillardian framework is well-applied and the argument is compelling and original.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper makes a significant contribution to Buffy scholarship by offering a genuinely fresh perspective on one of the series' most debated episodes. The author's central argument—that 'Normal Again' operates beyond traditional real/unreal distinctions to explore questions of choice and agency—is both original and well-supported. The application of Baudrillard's hyperreality theory is particularly effective, demonstrating how the asylum and Sunnydale function as perfect simulations where questions of authenticity become meaningless. The analysis of Buffy's choice as Nietzschean life affirmation is compelling, though it could be developed further. The paper successfully challenges Noxon's interpretation while building on Whedon's more complex understanding. The writing is clear and academically rigorous, with strong use of textual evidence. This work advances our understanding of the episode's philosophical sophistication and would be valuable to the field.</p>
