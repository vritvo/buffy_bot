                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to rescue 'Normal Again' from interpretations that see it as undermining Buffy's empowerment narrative, but does so through problematic theoretical application and misreading of textual evidence. The author correctly identifies that the episode has clear resolution favoring Sunnydale reality, but then constructs an argument about 'choice transcending ontological certainty' that the episode doesn't actually support. The script shows Buffy making a decisive choice to reject the asylum reality, not embracing interpretive ambiguity. The characterization of the Whedon-Noxon disagreement as reflecting sophisticated philosophical positions about empowerment is unsupported - Noxon simply rejected the asylum theory as undermining the show's themes, while Whedon acknowledged viewer interpretation flexibility. The paper's strongest insights concern the episode's treatment of adult responsibility and psychological trauma, but these are underdeveloped in favor of overstated claims about philosophical sophistication. The abandonment of the promised Baudrillard framework without explanation is particularly problematic for academic rigor.</p>

                        <p>While this paper demonstrates familiarity with the episode and attempts to engage with meaningful themes, it fundamentally misapplies its theoretical framework and makes several unsupported claims that undermine its central argument. The analysis would benefit from a complete reconceptualization of its approach.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to rescue 'Normal Again' from its reputation as a problematic episode by reframing it through psychological realism rather than postmodern theory. However, this approach fundamentally misunderstands the episode's actual content and resolution. The paper correctly identifies that the episode provides clear textual markers establishing the asylum as a demon-induced delusion, but then contradicts this by arguing the episode affirms choice-making independent of ontological status. The episode doesn't actually support this reading - Buffy's 'choice' to remain in Sunnydale occurs because she overcomes the demon's poison, not because she makes a philosophical decision about the nature of reality. The paper's treatment of the producer disagreement is valuable, but the analysis overstates what this disagreement reveals about the episode's themes. While the paper demonstrates strong close reading skills and familiarity with the text, its central theoretical framework doesn't align with the episode's actual narrative mechanics or thematic concerns.</p>
