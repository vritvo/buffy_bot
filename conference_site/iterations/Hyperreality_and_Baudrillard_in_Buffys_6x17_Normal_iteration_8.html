                        <p>While this paper tackles an intellectually ambitious topic and demonstrates familiarity with relevant theoretical frameworks, it suffers from significant methodological flaws, unsupported claims about authorial intent, and a fundamental misreading of the episode's actual narrative structure.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper presents an intellectually sophisticated reading that unfortunately rests on fundamental misreadings of both the episode's text and its production context. The author's claim that the episode maintains deliberate ambiguity contradicts the script's clear resolution: Buffy chooses to fight the demon and save her friends, while the final asylum scene shows her catatonic state as consequence, not alternative reality. The paper's central thesis about 'liberation from binary truth claims' cannot be sustained when the episode actually does resolve its reality question. Additionally, the author incorrectly attributes positions to Marti Noxon and Joss Whedon that contradict their actual statements and roles. While the theoretical framework is impressively developed and the Baudrillardian analysis shows genuine insight, the paper's foundation on textual misreading undermines its scholarly validity. The work would benefit from closer attention to the actual script and engagement with existing scholarship on this much-discussed episode.</p>

                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>While this paper tackles a sophisticated philosophical reading of 'Normal Again' through Baudrillard's simulation theory, it suffers from significant theoretical overreach and lacks sufficient textual evidence to support its ambitious claims. The argument frequently substitutes assertion for analysis.</p>

                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Theoretical framework is applied too broadly without sufficient textual grounding</li><li>Makes sweeping claims about Buffy's choice representing 'Nietzschean life affirmation' without adequate support from the episode</li><li>Overinterprets Joyce's asylum speech as working 'equally well from both perspectives' without demonstrating this claim</li><li>Lacks close analysis of key scenes and dialogue that would support the philosophical arguments</li><li>The connection between Baudrillard's hyperreality and the episode's asylum/reality dichotomy is asserted rather than demonstrated</li><li>Insufficient engagement with the actual viewing experience and emotional impact of the episode</li><li>The argument about the episode 'liberating viewers from binary truth claims' is not substantiated with evidence</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts an ambitious philosophical reading that, while intellectually interesting, fails to adequately ground its theoretical claims in the actual text of the episode. The author correctly identifies 'Normal Again' as philosophically sophisticated and the Baudrillardian framework has potential, but the analysis consistently leaps from textual observation to grand theoretical conclusion without sufficient intermediate steps. For example, the claim that Buffy's choice represents 'Nietzschean life affirmation' and 'Übermensch' behavior needs much more careful development through close reading of her actual dialogue and actions. The paper would benefit from more sustained analysis of specific scenes, particularly the asylum sequences and Buffy's interactions with the demon, to demonstrate how the episode actually constructs its simulation framework. The discussion of Joyce's speech is particularly problematic—the author claims it 'works equally well from both interpretive frameworks' but doesn't demonstrate this through careful analysis of the speech's content and context.</p>
