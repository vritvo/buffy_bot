                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>This paper presents a compelling and original theological interpretation of the Mayor-Faith relationship that moves beyond conventional paternal readings. The argument is well-supported with specific textual evidence and demonstrates sophisticated engagement with the source material.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Strengths</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Novel and well-articulated thesis positioning Faith as literal 'faith' and the Mayor as a divine figure requiring genuine belief</li><li>Strong textual support from the provided scripts, particularly Faith's immediate horror ('I didn't... I didn't know') and her final negotiation with the Mayor</li><li>Sophisticated theological framework drawing on Old Testament patterns of conditional divine love</li><li>Effective contrast between the Mayor-Faith dynamic and the Giles-Buffy relationship as different models of chosen family</li><li>Corrected factual errors from previous version and provided more grounded analysis of Faith's psychological state</li><li>Insightful analysis of the Mayor's consistent truthfulness and Christian moral language as evidence of theological rather than purely manipulative character</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Some interpretive claims remain speculative, particularly regarding the Mayor's 'inability to lie' - the text shows honesty but doesn't definitively establish inability to deceive</li><li>The theological framework, while compelling, occasionally risks over-reading symbolic elements at the expense of character psychology</li><li>Could benefit from more engagement with existing scholarship on religious themes in Buffy studies</li><li>The analysis of Faith's agency could be strengthened with additional textual examples beyond the final confrontation scene</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This revised paper successfully addresses previous criticisms while maintaining its innovative theological interpretation. The author has corrected factual errors about timing and Faith's immediate reaction to Allan's death, providing accurate script citations that support rather than contradict the argument. The analysis of Faith's horror and panic ('I didn't... I didn't know. I didn't know.') followed by her defensive posturing ('I don't care!') effectively demonstrates the psychological preparation for theological submission rather than immediate callousness. The theological framework is sophisticated and well-applied, particularly the insight that Faith's status as a Slayer makes her belief more valuable for divine legitimacy than that of vampires or human employees. The contrast with Giles's approach to Faith's deception illuminates different models of authority and care. The paper makes a significant contribution to Buffy scholarship by offering a fresh perspective on a well-studied relationship and demonstrating how religious themes operate within the series' exploration of power and moral responsibility.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This revised paper demonstrates significant improvement over previous versions, addressing key criticisms while maintaining its innovative theological interpretation. The author now correctly identifies Faith's immediate horror at Allan's death ('I didn't... I didn't know') rather than claiming immediate theological submission, and provides substantial evidence for Faith's continued agency throughout her relationship with the Mayor. The textual analysis is particularly strong, drawing effectively from the provided scripts to support claims about Faith's defensive 'I don't care!' as psychological protection rather than genuine indifference. The theological framework is sophisticated, positioning Faith as providing the authentic belief necessary for divine legitimacy rather than mere companionship. The contrast with the Giles-Buffy relationship illuminates different models of chosen family and authority structures. While some interpretive claims remain arguable, the overall argument is well-supported and makes a meaningful contribution to Buffy scholarship by offering a fresh perspective on a central relationship in Season 3.</p>
