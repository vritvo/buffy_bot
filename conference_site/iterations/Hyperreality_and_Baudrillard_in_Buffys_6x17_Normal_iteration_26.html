                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>This paper offers a sophisticated philosophical reading of 'Normal Again' that successfully moves beyond simple reality/delusion binaries to explore deeper questions about choice, meaning-making, and authentic agency. While the argument could benefit from more precise engagement with textual details that complicate the interpretive ambiguity, the theoretical framework is well-applied and the contribution to Buffy scholarship is significant.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper makes a valuable contribution to Buffy scholarship by offering a sophisticated philosophical reading that moves beyond traditional interpretations of 'Normal Again.' The author's use of Baudrillard's theory of simulation and hyperreality is well-applied and illuminating, particularly in demonstrating how both the asylum and Sunnydale achieve internal coherence as explanatory frameworks. The analysis of Joyce's climactic speech is particularly strong, showing how the dialogue transcends ontological categories to speak to fundamental questions of choice and self-determination. However, the paper would be strengthened by more precise engagement with textual details that complicate the argument. While the episode maintains ambiguity, it does structurally privilege Sunnydale through specific visual cues, parallel staging, and narrative resolution that the paper acknowledges but doesn't fully integrate into its argument. The revelation of Buffy's psychiatric history also deserves more thorough analysis as it complicates any simple reading of the asylum as pure simulation. The paper's contemporary relevance and positioning within broader philosophical discussions is commendable, and the writing is clear and engaging throughout.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper makes a significant contribution to Buffy scholarship by offering a genuinely fresh perspective on one of the series' most analyzed episodes. The author's central argument—that 'Normal Again' achieves philosophical sophistication through interpretive ambiguity rather than ontological resolution—is compelling and well-supported. The close reading of key scenes, particularly Joyce's speech and Buffy's final choice, demonstrates how the episode's dialogue functions across both interpretive frameworks without privileging either. The Baudrillardian framework is expertly applied, showing how both worlds achieve the internal consistency characteristic of successful simulation. The paper's strength lies in its recognition that the episode's meaning emerges through Buffy's moral agency rather than through correspondence to external truth. The analysis of how the episode structurally privileges Sunnydale while maintaining interpretive ambiguity is particularly insightful. The connection to contemporary discussions of virtual reality and digital existence adds relevance without forcing anachronistic readings.</p>
