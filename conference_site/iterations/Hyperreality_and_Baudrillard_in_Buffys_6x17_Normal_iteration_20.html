                        <p>While the paper demonstrates sophisticated theoretical knowledge and addresses an intellectually compelling episode, it suffers from significant foundational problems including factual errors, unsupported claims about production history, and insufficient grounding in the actual episode text.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper demonstrates impressive theoretical sophistication in its application of Baudrillard's concepts to 'Normal Again,' and the central argument about the episode transcending reality/delusion binaries is compelling. The philosophical reading of Buffy's choice as authentic agency regardless of ontological status shows genuine insight. However, the paper is fundamentally undermined by its reliance on fabricated production history and insufficient engagement with the actual episode text. The author makes sweeping claims about the episode's construction without providing adequate evidence from the script itself. While the theoretical framework is sound, it feels imposed upon the material rather than emerging from careful textual analysis. The paper would benefit significantly from removing all unsubstantiated production claims and instead grounding its arguments in specific dialogue, scenes, and narrative moments from the episode. The insight about Joyce's speech working from both interpretive perspectives is excellent, but needs to be supported with actual quotations and deeper analysis of how the episode achieves this dual functionality.</p>

                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>While this paper tackles an intellectually ambitious topic and demonstrates familiarity with Baudrillard's theoretical framework, it suffers from significant analytical overreach and insufficient textual grounding. The argument that the episode transcends reality/delusion binaries is compelling in theory but not adequately supported by close reading of the actual script.</p>

                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Significant disconnect between theoretical claims and actual script evidence</li><li>Overinterpretation of dialogue and scenes to fit predetermined theoretical framework</li><li>Insufficient close textual analysis of key moments in the episode</li><li>Claims about the episode's 'genius' and 'sophistication' not adequately demonstrated</li><li>Tendency to impose Baudrillardian reading rather than derive it from the text</li><li>Missing engagement with the episode's actual emotional and narrative structure</li><li>Failure to address how the script's ending complicates the proposed reading</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>The paper's central argument—that 'Normal Again' operates beyond binary truth claims through Baudrillardian simulation—is intellectually intriguing but poorly executed. The author claims the episode achieves 'perfect simulation' where both realities are 'functionally indistinguishable,' yet the script clearly privileges the Sunnydale reality through its emotional resolution and Buffy's decisive choice. The paper's analysis of Joyce's speech as 'completely interpretive flexible' overlooks the script's actual context, where Joyce's words specifically encourage Buffy to 'fight' her delusion. The author's reading of Buffy's final 'Good-bye' as transcending ontological categories ignores that this moment occurs specifically within the asylum framework as Buffy chooses to reject that reality. While the Baudrillardian framework has potential, the paper needs substantial revision to ground its theoretical insights in rigorous textual analysis rather than imposing predetermined conclusions onto the episode.</p>
