                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>This paper presents a sophisticated and theoretically grounded analysis of 'Normal Again' through Baudrillard's simulation theory, making a significant contribution to Buffy scholarship by demonstrating how the episode transcends simple reality/fiction binaries to achieve true hyperreality.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Strengths</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Excellent application of Baudrillard's four stages of simulation theory to demonstrate how the episode operates in the fourth stage of 'pure simulacrum'</li><li>Insightful analysis of the Whedon-Noxon producer disagreement as representing different philosophical approaches to hyperreality</li><li>Strong textual evidence throughout, with accurate script citations that effectively support the theoretical framework</li><li>Sophisticated reading of Joyce's asylum speech as achieving 'more real than real' status regardless of ontological validation</li><li>Compelling argument that the episode's achievement lies not in resolving questions of truth but in transcending them entirely</li><li>Excellent integration of Season 6 themes as meta-commentary on adult responsibility and disillusionment</li><li>Clear demonstration of how the episode anticipates contemporary concerns about virtual reality and simulated experience</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Some sections could benefit from more direct engagement with existing Buffy scholarship to better situate this reading within the field</li><li>The connection between the demon's poison and hyperreality mechanics, while interesting, feels slightly underdeveloped</li><li>Minor organizational issue where the meta-commentary section might flow better if integrated earlier in the argument</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper successfully delivers on its ambitious theoretical promise by demonstrating how 'Normal Again' achieves what Baudrillard describes as perfect simulation. The author's key insight—that the episode doesn't simply question which reality is 'true' but renders such questions meaningless—is well-supported throughout. The analysis of Joyce's speech as functioning authentically regardless of its ontological status is particularly compelling, as is the reading of Buffy's choice as representing authentic agency independent of external validation. The script citations are accurate and effectively deployed, particularly in showing how the episode's structural ambiguity (ending with both realities continuing to exist) supports the hyperreality thesis. The discussion of the producer disagreement adds valuable context while illuminating different approaches to simulation theory. The paper makes a genuine contribution to Buffy studies by offering a sophisticated philosophical reading that connects the show to broader questions about meaning-making in an age of simulation.</p>

                        <p>This paper presents a sophisticated and well-executed analysis of 'Normal Again' through Baudrillard's simulation theory, demonstrating genuine scholarly merit and making a meaningful contribution to Buffy studies.

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper succeeds admirably in its ambitious goal of reading 'Normal Again' through Baudrillard's simulation theory. The author demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of both the theoretical framework and the episode's complex narrative structure. The central argument—that the episode achieves a collapse of reality/simulation distinctions rather than simply questioning which reality is 'true'—is original and well-supported. The analysis of the producer disagreement is particularly insightful, showing how Noxon's position represents nostalgia for clear ontological distinctions while Whedon's approach embraces hyperreality's liberating potential. The textual evidence is used effectively throughout, with accurate script citations that illuminate key moments. The discussion of Joyce's asylum speech as transcending ontological categories is especially compelling. While there are minor areas for improvement, this paper makes a genuine contribution to Buffy scholarship by offering a fresh theoretical lens for understanding one of the series' most philosophically complex episodes.</p>
