                <p>This paper challenges conventional interpretations of the Mayor-Faith relationship in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 3 as primarily paternal, instead proposing a theological framework that positions Faith as literal "faith" and the Mayor as a divine figure whose authority depends on genuine belief. Through close analysis of episodes 3.14 "Bad Girls" and 3.15 "Consequences," this study argues that Faith's moral crisis following Allan Finch's accidental death creates the psychological conditions necessary for theological covenant rather than simple parental substitution. Unlike vampires who fear the Mayor's power or human employees who respect his authority, Faith as a Slayer provides something essential for divine transformation: authentic belief that legitimizes transcendence. The analysis reveals how the Mayor's consistent truthfulness, biblical moral language, and conditional love follow Old Testament patterns of divine favor dependent on faithful devotion. This theological interpretation explains both the authentic emotion in their relationship and its ultimately possessive nature, while distinguishing it from the genuinely supportive chosen family structure represented by Giles and Buffy.</p>
