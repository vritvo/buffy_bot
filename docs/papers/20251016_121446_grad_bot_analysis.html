    <title>This paper examines how Buffy the Vampire Slayer's episode 'Normal Again' (6.17) moves beyond conventional narrative depictions of dreams and hallucinations as less than real and instead posits the alternative world of the asylum on equal terms as Buffy-in-Sunnydale. The question of whether the asylum is real or not does not merely not matter (as the show superficially seems to suggest), the whole question is meaningless, because as constructed in the episode, reality and truth cease to be a part of the language game of Buffy, invoking Wittgenstein.</title>
