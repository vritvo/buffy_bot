                <p>This paper examines the character development of Spike across seven seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a philosophical journey from failed Nietzschean Übermensch to authentic Kantian moral agent. Initially presenting characteristics that appear to align with Nietzschean ideals—strategic thinking, rejection of conventional morality, and embrace of vampiric nature—Spike's obsession with Buffy reveals him as fundamentally driven by resentment rather than authentic self-creation of values. The Initiative's chip in Season 4 functions as external moral constraint, creating what parallels Christian morality's external authority structure. Spike's decision to seek a soul in Season 6 represents a crucial shift from external to internal moral authority. The church confession scene in Season 7's "Beneath You" crystallizes this transformation, where Spike confesses not his vampire crimes but his choice to become "a kind of man," embracing moral responsibility through self-imposed constraints rather than external compulsion. This progression demonstrates movement toward Kantian moral agency based on duty and rational will rather than Nietzschean self-assertion, suggesting that authentic moral development requires both recognition of universal moral principles and personal commitment to ethical action.</p>
