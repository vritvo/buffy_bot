                <p>This paper examines the evolution of moral philosophy in Buffy the Vampire Slayer through the show's increasingly inconsistent treatment of souls, arguing that the series ultimately rejects essentialist approaches to ethics in favor of constructivist moral agency. Initially, Joss Whedon established a clear binary where souls determine moral capacity, literalizing high school struggles through supernatural metaphor. However, this framework quickly breaks down as the series presents sympathetic demons and morally complex vampires, forcing both characters and viewers toward a more nuanced understanding of ethical behavior. The chip implanted in Spike serves as a crucial philosophical experiment: if vampires can develop moral intuitions through external constraints rather than internal essence, this suggests that moral capacity emerges through practice and habituation rather than metaphysical endowment. Dawn's observation that "Spike has a chip. Same diff" as Angel's soul directly challenges Buffy's essentialist thinking, while Anya's transformation from demon to moral agent through loss of powers rather than soul restoration demonstrates that ethical development occurs through choice and integration rather than metaphysical transformation. The series' treatment of souls as simultaneously storable objects and aspects of consciousness creates an intentional ambiguity that mirrors Wittgenstein's "beetle in a box" problem—we can only judge moral capacity through external expressions and behavioral patterns, never through direct access to internal states. This analysis positions Buffy as ultimately rejecting both traditional Christian soul-based morality and nihilistic moral relativism in favor of a pragmatic ethics grounded in choice, consequence, and community responsibility.</p>
