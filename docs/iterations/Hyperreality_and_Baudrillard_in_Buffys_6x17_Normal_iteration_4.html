                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to apply Baudrillard's theory of simulation and hyperreality to 'Normal Again,' arguing that the episode transcends reality/fiction binaries. However, this interpretation fundamentally misunderstands both Baudrillard's concepts and the episode itself. Baudrillard's hyperreality describes a condition where simulations precede and replace reality in postmodern media culture - not a psychological condition where an individual cannot distinguish between competing realities. The episode is explicitly about mental illness and psychological breakdown, not postmodern simulation. The paper ignores crucial evidence: the episode clearly establishes the asylum as a delusion through multiple textual markers (the demon's poison causing hallucinations, the antidote's effectiveness, the catatonic ending). The author's claim that both realities are 'equally valid simulations' contradicts the episode's clear narrative structure and resolution. Furthermore, the paper mischaracterizes the Whedon-Noxon disagreement, creating a false philosophical divide where none exists in the source material. The theoretical apparatus, while sophisticated, is inappropriately applied and obscures rather than illuminates the episode's actual themes of trauma, mental health, and the difficulty of accepting painful realities.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to rescue 'Normal Again' from dismissal by applying Baudrillard's simulation theory, but the theoretical framework is poorly matched to the episode's actual content. Baudrillard's concept of hyperreality describes a condition where simulation precedes and replaces reality entirely, making the real/simulation distinction meaningless. However, 'Normal Again' explicitly maintains two distinct, competing realities with clear ontological boundaries - the asylum and Sunnydale remain separate interpretive possibilities rather than collapsed simulations. The paper's claim that the episode 'liberates viewers from binary truth claims' contradicts the episode's fundamental structure, which depends precisely on the tension between these binary possibilities. The Nietzschean reading feels particularly forced - Buffy's choice to remain in Sunnydale (if the asylum is real) could equally represent psychological denial rather than life affirmation. The analysis of Joyce's speech lacks nuance; while the words may be applicable in both scenarios, their emotional weight and narrative function differ significantly. The paper would benefit from engaging with the episode's actual themes of mental illness, trauma, and the burden of heroic responsibility rather than imposing external philosophical frameworks.</p>
