                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>While this paper demonstrates improved theoretical grounding compared to its apparent predecessor, it fundamentally misrepresents the episode's content and creates a false interpretive framework that contradicts the actual script. The paper's central premise that the episode provides 'clear textual evidence establishing the asylum as a hallucination' is demonstrably incorrect.</p>

                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Fundamental misreading of the episode's ending - the script clearly shows the asylum reality continuing after Buffy's choice</li><li>Incorrect claim about 'clear textual evidence' when the episode deliberately maintains ambiguity</li><li>Misrepresentation of the demon's role - it's deployed by the Nerds, not a random encounter</li><li>Overstatement of the episode's 'medical framework' when supernatural elements remain prominent</li><li>False binary between 'medical' and 'supernatural' explanations that the episode explicitly refuses</li><li>Selective quotation that ignores contradictory evidence from the script</li>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to resolve 'Normal Again's' deliberate ambiguity by arguing that the episode provides clear evidence favoring the Sunnydale reality, but this interpretation cannot be sustained against the actual script. The episode's final scene explicitly shows the asylum continuing to exist after Buffy makes her choice, with the doctor declaring 'I'm afraid we lost her' as Joyce sobs - hardly evidence of a 'clear resolution' favoring one reality over another. The paper's claim that the demon's poison provides a 'pharmacological explanation' ignores that this explanation exists only within the Sunnydale reality and could equally be part of Buffy's delusion. While the paper offers valuable insights about the episode's treatment of trauma and agency, its fundamental misreading of the text undermines its scholarly credibility. The analysis of the producer disagreement is well-handled, but the paper's insistence on resolving the episode's intentional ambiguity contradicts both Whedon's explicit statements about interpretive flexibility and the episode's actual structure.</p>

                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>While this paper demonstrates sophisticated theoretical engagement and clear writing, it fundamentally misapplies its chosen theoretical framework and misrepresents key aspects of the episode's content and resolution.</p>

                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Complete abandonment of the stated theoretical framework (Baudrillard/simulation theory) without adequate justification</li><li>Mischaracterization of the episode's resolution - it clearly establishes the asylum as demon-induced hallucination, not genuine ambiguity</li><li>Overstatement of the episode's philosophical sophistication without sufficient textual support</li><li>Failure to engage meaningfully with the title's promised focus on 'hyperreality and Baudrillard'</li><li>Inconsistent argument that shifts between acknowledging clear resolution and claiming interpretive flexibility</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper suffers from a fundamental disconnect between its stated theoretical approach and its actual analysis. The title promises an examination of Baudrillard's simulation theory in relation to 'Normal Again,' but the paper quickly abandons this framework entirely in favor of a psychological realism reading. While the psychological analysis is competent and the writing is strong, this represents a bait-and-switch that undermines the paper's academic integrity. More problematically, the paper misrepresents the episode's clear textual resolution. The script explicitly establishes the asylum as a demon-induced hallucination through medical framework, timing of visions, and narrative structure. The paper's claim that the episode maintains genuine ambiguity contradicts the textual evidence. The analysis of the Whedon-Noxon disagreement is insightful, but the paper overstates this as evidence of the episode's philosophical sophistication rather than recognizing it as a disagreement about interpretation rather than authorial intent. The psychological trauma analysis is the paper's strongest element, but it cannot salvage the fundamental theoretical and textual misrepresentations.</p>
