                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to map Spike's character development onto a philosophical trajectory from failed Übermensch to Kantian moral agent, but the analysis suffers from fundamental misreadings of both the source material and the philosophical frameworks employed. The author's interpretation of Spike as initially 'Übermensch-like' misunderstands both Spike's character and Nietzsche's concept. In 'School Hard,' Spike rejects vampire hierarchy and convention ('Do you know what I find works real good with Slayers? Killing them'), but this represents creating his own vampiric values, not transcending good and evil in the Nietzschean sense. The flashbacks in 'Fool for Love' reveal William as fundamentally empathetic and driven by desire for beauty and connection, not resentment. His transformation occurs through Drusilla's recognition of his imaginative nature ('You walk in worlds the others can't begin to imagine'), not through resentful inversion of social hierarchies. The paper's Kantian reading is more persuasive, particularly regarding the soul quest as movement toward internal moral authority, but it oversimplifies the complexity of Spike's moral development by forcing it into a binary philosophical framework. The analysis would benefit from engaging more deeply with the actual content of both philosophical systems rather than applying them as convenient labels.</p>

                        <p>While the paper demonstrates familiarity with Buffy scholarship and attempts a sophisticated philosophical analysis, it suffers from significant theoretical misapplications and lacks sufficient textual evidence to support its central claims about Spike's philosophical transformation.</p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>The paper's central argument that Spike moves from failed Übermensch to Kantian moral agent is undermined by fundamental misunderstandings of both philosophical frameworks. The author correctly identifies that Spike's initial vampiric persona is driven by resentment (particularly the 'beneath me' trauma), but incorrectly characterizes this as 'failed Übermensch status.' Nietzsche's Übermensch concept doesn't involve rejecting conventional morality through resentment—that would indeed be slave morality—but rather creating new values beyond the binary of good and evil. The paper would benefit from distinguishing between Spike's surface rebellion and authentic value creation. Additionally, the claim that Spike develops 'empathetic abilities' is not well-supported by the provided script evidence, which shows him as manipulative rather than genuinely empathetic. The Kantian analysis is more promising but needs deeper development of how duty-based ethics actually manifest in Spike's post-soul behavior. The paper's treatment of the chip as enabling moral discovery is interesting but requires more nuanced analysis of the relationship between external constraint and moral agency.</p>
