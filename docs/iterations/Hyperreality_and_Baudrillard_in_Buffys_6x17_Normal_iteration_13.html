                        <p>While this paper tackles a fascinating and philosophically rich episode, it suffers from significant theoretical misapplication, factual inaccuracies, and a fundamental misunderstanding of Baudrillard's concepts that undermines its central argument.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>The paper's central flaw lies in its misapplication of Baudrillard's hyperreality concept. Baudrillard's theory concerns how media representations become more 'real' than reality itself in consumer culture, not the ontological status of competing realities within a fictional narrative. The asylum and Sunnydale don't represent simulation and original but rather two different interpretations of the same character's experience. The paper would be stronger focusing on the episode's actual themes: trauma, mental health stigma, and the difficulty of distinguishing between psychological healing and psychological denial. The Nietzschean reading, while creative, doesn't engage with how the episode actually presents choice - Buffy's decision isn't amor fati but rather a rejection of therapeutic discourse that pathologizes her experiences. The paper also misses the episode's genuine innovation in presenting mental illness without resolution, leaving viewers genuinely uncertain about Buffy's ontological status in ways that complicate rather than transcend truth claims.</p>

                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>While the paper tackles an intellectually ambitious topic with sophisticated theoretical frameworks, it suffers from significant methodological flaws and misrepresentations of the source material that undermine its central arguments.</p>

                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Misattributes creative control - Noxon was showrunner for Season 6, not just offering interpretation</li><li>Overstates Whedon's embrace of ambiguity - his actual quote shows preference for one interpretation</li><li>Lacks textual evidence for key claims about Joyce's asylum speech being 'idealized'</li><li>Theoretical application feels forced rather than emerging organically from the text</li><li>Ignores crucial script details that complicate the argument (like Buffy's previous institutionalization)</li><li>No engagement with existing Buffy scholarship on this episode</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>The paper's central weakness lies in its misrepresentation of the creative tensions behind 'Normal Again.' The author presents Noxon as dismissing the asylum theory from outside the text, when she was actually the showrunner who crafted the episode's narrative structure. This fundamental error undermines the paper's framework of opposing Noxon's 'binary logic' with Whedon's 'sophisticated ambiguity.' The Baudrillardian analysis, while intellectually ambitious, feels imposed rather than discovered - the paper doesn't adequately demonstrate how the episode actually operates according to simulation theory beyond surface-level parallels. The claim that Joyce's asylum speech represents 'hyperreality' lacks textual support; the script shows her as genuinely caring rather than 'more real than real.' Most problematically, the paper ignores Buffy's revelation about her previous institutionalization, which significantly complicates any reading of the episode as pure philosophical meditation. The theoretical sophistication cannot compensate for these fundamental interpretive and factual errors.</p>
