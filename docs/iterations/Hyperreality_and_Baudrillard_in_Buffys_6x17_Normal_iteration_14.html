                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>While this paper tackles a philosophically rich episode and demonstrates clear engagement with theoretical frameworks, it suffers from fundamental misapplication of its central theoretical approach and lacks sufficient textual grounding. The paper would benefit from major revisions to align its theoretical framework with the actual content of the episode.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to tackle one of Buffy's most philosophically complex episodes but struggles with both theoretical application and textual analysis. The central problem is the misapplication of Baudrillard's hyperreality concept. 'Normal Again' does not collapse distinctions between real and simulated as the paper claims; rather, it maintains clear hierarchies while exploring questions of choice and meaning within those hierarchies. The episode presents two competing realities (asylum vs. Sunnydale) that remain ontologically distinct throughout. The paper would be stronger if it abandoned the Baudrillardian framework entirely or significantly revised it. Additionally, the analysis lacks close engagement with the actual episode content. Key scenes like Joyce's asylum speech, the doctor's meta-commentary, and especially the final catatonic sequence receive insufficient attention. The paper makes undocumented claims about creative disagreements that need proper sourcing or should be clearly marked as speculation. The Nietzschean reading, while potentially valuable, needs to emerge more organically from textual evidence rather than being imposed upon the material.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to rescue 'Normal Again' from dismissive readings by applying sophisticated philosophical frameworks, which is commendable in principle. However, the execution reveals several critical problems. The central theoretical framework misapplies Baudrillard's concept of hyperreality to an episode that actually maintains clear distinctions between real and simulated rather than collapsing them. The paper would benefit from either abandoning this framework entirely or substantially revising the argument to acknowledge how the episode preserves rather than eliminates ontological hierarchies. Additionally, while the author has access to the complete episode script, the analysis relies too heavily on abstract philosophical speculation rather than close textual engagement. Key scenes like Joyce's asylum speech and the doctor's meta-commentary are mentioned but not thoroughly analyzed in relation to the actual dialogue. The discussion of production context, while potentially valuable, lacks proper documentation and appears speculative. Most significantly, the paper fails to adequately grapple with how the episode's horror elements—particularly the disturbing final image of catatonic Buffy—complicate the empowerment narrative the author wishes to preserve.</p>
