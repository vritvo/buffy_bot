                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts an ambitious philosophical reading of 'Normal Again' but fails to execute it convincingly. The author mischaracterizes Noxon's position—she didn't simply dismiss the asylum theory as undermining empowerment, but rather expressed concern about how it might be interpreted by viewers. The application of Baudrillard's simulation theory feels forced and underdeveloped; the author doesn't adequately explain how Sunnydale functions as 'hyperreality' or why this framework is more illuminating than existing interpretations. The Nietzschean reading similarly lacks grounding—there's no clear textual evidence that Buffy's choice represents 'amor fati' rather than simply choosing her friends and responsibilities. Most problematically, several key quotes are inaccurate or taken out of context, undermining the paper's credibility. The author also ignores substantial existing scholarship on this episode, particularly work on reality, identity, and mental illness in Buffy studies.</p>

                        <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
                        <p>While this paper tackles an important and philosophically rich episode, it suffers from significant theoretical misapplication, weak textual evidence, and fails to engage meaningfully with existing Buffy scholarship or the actual content of the episode.</p>

                        <li>Fundamental misapplication of Baudrillard's simulation theory - the episode doesn't present 'perfect simulation' but rather competing reality claims</li><li>Lacks engagement with existing Buffy scholarship and secondary sources</li><li>Minimal use of actual script evidence despite having access to the full episode transcript</li><li>Overstates Joyce's speech as 'universal' when it appears in only one reality (asylum) in the actual episode</li><li>Mischaracterizes the episode's ending as 'ambiguous' when the final shot clearly shows catatonic Buffy</li><li>Theoretical framework doesn't match the episode's actual philosophical concerns about mental illness and reality</li><li>Claims about Nietzschean 'life affirmation' are unsupported by textual evidence</li>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>This paper attempts to rescue 'Normal Again' from dismissive readings by applying postmodern theory, but it fundamentally misunderstands both Baudrillard's concepts and the episode itself. Baudrillard's 'perfect simulation' refers to simulations that become more real than reality itself, but 'Normal Again' presents a binary choice between two competing realities rather than a hyperreal simulation. The paper's central claim that Joyce's speech 'works equally well from both interpretations' is factually incorrect - the speech only appears in the asylum reality. The author has access to the complete script but uses almost no specific dialogue or scenes to support their arguments. The theoretical application feels forced rather than organic to the text, and the paper doesn't engage with the substantial existing scholarship on this episode or broader discussions of mental illness representation in Buffy. While the attempt to defend the episode's sophistication is admirable, the execution undermines the argument through poor textual analysis and theoretical misapplication.</p>
