                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Lacks concrete textual evidence from actual episodes to support central claims</li><li>Makes unsupported assertions about the Mayor's truthfulness without script verification</li><li>Overstates Faith's 'conscious choice' to worship the Mayor based on limited evidence</li><li>Fails to engage with existing scholarship on Buffy or provide adequate theoretical grounding</li><li>Ignores significant counterevidence that contradicts the theological interpretation</li><li>Does not address the Mayor's clear deception and manipulation throughout the series</li>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>The paper's central argument that Faith functions as literal 'faith' enabling the Mayor's ascension is intellectually compelling but lacks the rigorous textual support necessary for academic credibility. The author makes several unsubstantiated claims, particularly regarding the Mayor's supposed truthfulness and Faith's 'conscious choice' to renounce independence. The scripts show Faith approaching the Mayor pragmatically after killing Allan Finch, seeking protection rather than religious conversion. The theological framework, while sophisticated, is imposed rather than emerging organically from the text. The paper would benefit from substantial revision incorporating specific dialogue analysis, engagement with existing Buffy scholarship, and acknowledgment of contradictory evidence such as the Mayor's extensive deception throughout Season 3.</p>

                        <h4>Detailed Comments</h4>
                        <p>The paper's central thesis that Faith functions as literal 'faith' enabling the Mayor's ascension is conceptually interesting but inadequately supported by textual evidence. While the author claims the Mayor 'never lies' and consistently uses 'biblical language,' the provided scripts show him as a typical politician who uses folksy rhetoric rather than specifically Christian terminology. His comment about Family Circus and concern for cleanliness read more as characterization of small-town American values than theological positioning. The paper would benefit from closer textual analysis of actual dialogue and scenes. The comparison with Giles-Buffy is the strongest section, but even here the analysis relies more on assertion than demonstration. The theological framework, while creative, needs substantial grounding in specific textual moments to be convincing. The paper reads more like an extended interpretive exercise than rigorous scholarship.</p>
