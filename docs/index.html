<h2>About Slayer<span>&shy;</span>fest '03</h2>
<p>For seven seasons, <em>Buffy</em> has offered more than monster-of-the-week entertainment. It has staged fundamental questions about existential responsibility, the construction of feminine heroism, and the unconscious forces that shape identity and desire. Slayerfest '03 brought together leading scholars to interrogate these themes with the seriousness they deserve.</p>
<p>Yet the work of interpretation has only begun. Through philosophy, psychoanalysis, and feminist theory, this inaugural gathering established a foundation for a tradition of analysis that refuses to condescend to its subject matter. Even as the end of the world remains a recurring threat, our scholarship is structured to endure it.</p>
<p>The papers archived here represent the best of that work: rigorously reviewed, carefully revised, and ultimately accepted into the official proceedings. We extend sincere gratitude to all presenters, reviewers, administrative procedures, and <a class="glitch-text" href="technical_documentation.html" style="--delay: 0.15s; --flicker-duration: 7.73s; --shift-duration: 10.89s">unseen labor</a> that made this conference possible.</p>

                <h3>Maternal Panic and Mob Mentality in 3x11 'Gingerbread': A Nietzschean Analysis of Slave Morality</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>Joss Whedon's "Gingerbread" (3x11) operates as a sophisticated philosophical meditation on what Nietzsche termed "slave morality," demonstrating how fear-based moral systems can be weaponized against exceptional individuals who transcend conventional boundaries. Through the demon's manipulation of the Mothers Opposed to the Occult (MOO), the episode reveals how communities project their anxieties onto scapegoats, transforming protective instincts into persecutory ones. The demon's manifestation as the murdered children "Hansel and Gretel" exploits existing moral frameworks rather than creating new ones, showing how traditional values can be corrupted when driven by resentment and fear. Joyce's declaration to the demon children that she "wanted a normal, happy daughter. Instead I got a Slayer" exemplifies slave morality's rejection of the Übermensch figure who operates beyond ordinary moral categories. The episode's invocation of book-burning imagery connects contemporary moral panic to historical patterns of persecution, while Buffy's burning at the stake reinforces Joan of Arc parallels, positioning both as exceptional women whose independent action challenges established patriarchal order. By revealing the children as a single demon feeding on collective hatred, "Gingerbread" exposes how moral panics emerge not from external threats but from communities' willingness to sacrifice difference on the altar of conformity, creating a prescient critique of scapegoating mechanisms that anticipates contemporary discussions of persecution and mob mentality.</p></div>

                <h3>Institutional Critique and Patriarchal Authority in 4x10 'Hush': Silence as Resistance</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>This paper examines "Hush" (4.10) as a sophisticated exploration of communication, institutional authority, and authentic connection, analyzing how the episode's enforced silence reveals the limitations of formal power structures while opening spaces for genuine human connection. The Gentlemen function as an embodiment of institutional authority that maintains surface politeness while enacting violence through subordinates, whose primary weapon is silencing—removing the capacity to speak, protest, or organize collective action. The episode presents three distinct institutional structures that fail when stripped of verbal communication: the Gentlemen (formal authority), the Initiative (military hierarchy), and the Wicca group (performative activism). In contrast, genuine effectiveness emerges from individuals and pairs operating outside these frameworks—Buffy and Riley in combat, Willow and Tara in magical partnership. The episode's technical innovation of minimal dialogue in a dialogue-heavy series demonstrates that authentic communication transcends verbal exchange, while Buffy's climactic scream destroys the monsters not through traditional rescue narrative but through reclaimed vocal power. The development of Willow and Tara's relationship within this framework suggests that authentic connection itself functions as resistance to institutional control, developing in spaces beyond formal recognition or approval.</p></div>

                <h3>The Slayer as Binary Deconstruction: Post-Freudian Power and Gender Subversion in Buffy</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>This paper examines the construction of the Slayer in <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> as a liminal figure who complicates rather than reinforces traditional moral binaries. Through analysis of key episodes including "Bad Girls" (3x14) and "Fool for Love" (5x07), this study argues that the series reveals significant parallels between Slayers and vampires that challenge conventional categories of good and evil. Rather than serving as humanity's unambiguous champion, the Slayer emerges as a figure who exists in the spaces between traditional moral frameworks, possessing attributes that align her more closely with vampiric nature than with ordinary human morality. This positioning creates what can be understood as a post-Freudian space where power, rather than virtue, becomes the organizing principle, while simultaneously subverting traditional gender associations with strength and violence. The paper demonstrates how <em>Buffy</em> uses the Slayer concept to explore moral complexity rather than to reinforce simple binary oppositions.</p></div>

                <h3>Hyperreality and Baudrillard in Buffy's 6x17 'Normal Again': The Asylum as Simulation</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>This paper examines Buffy the Vampire Slayer's "Normal Again" (6x17) through the lens of Jean Baudrillard's theories of simulation and hyperreality. While production tensions between Joss Whedon and Marti Noxon reveal competing interpretations of the episode's asylum/reality dichotomy, textual analysis demonstrates that the episode transcends simple binary distinctions between "real" and "fictional" experiences. Drawing on Baudrillard's concept that perfect simulations become more real than reality itself, this paper argues that "Normal Again" presents Sunnydale not as a delusion to be escaped but as a hyperreal simulation that gains authenticity through Buffy's complete investment in it. The episode's deliberate ambiguity functions as a philosophical statement about the irrelevance of ontological truth when perfect simulations provide more meaningful frameworks for existence. Rather than invalidating Buffy's empowerment, the asylum possibility strengthens it by demonstrating that her heroism emerges from choice rather than destiny, making her commitment to the Slayer identity a supreme act of existential self-determination.</p></div>

                <h3>Spike's Journey: From Nietzschean Übermensch to Kantian Moral Agent</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>This paper reexamines Spike's character development in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, challenging previous interpretations that position him as initially embodying Nietzschean Übermensch characteristics. Through close analysis of key episodes including "School Hard" (2x03), "Fool for Love" (5x07), and "Beneath You" (7x02), I argue that Spike's apparent self-creation of values masks a deeper foundation of empathetic connection and recognition-seeking that ultimately enables authentic moral development. Rather than representing a simple progression from Nietzschean to Kantian frameworks, Spike's journey reveals the complex relationship between external moral constraints and internal moral capacity. His transformation from the chip's behavioral modification to voluntary soul acquisition demonstrates that genuine moral agency emerges not from the transcendence of moral frameworks, but from the willing acceptance of moral responsibility grounded in empathetic understanding of others.</p></div>

                <h3>Dancing with Death: Violence, Sexuality, and the Slayer's Death Wish in Season 5</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>Season Five of Buffy the Vampire Slayer presents a sophisticated examination of the Slayer's relationship to mortality through the central metaphor of "dancing" introduced in "Fool for Love." This analysis argues that Spike's provocative claim that "every Slayer has a death wish" should be understood not as pathological self-destruction but as a complex negotiation between violence, recognition, and authentic engagement with mortality. The "dancing" metaphor, while appearing primarily in one pivotal scene, illuminates how combat serves as a form of intimate communication about power and acknowledgment between opponents. Through careful analysis of the visual language in key episodes and Buffy's ultimate sacrifice in "The Gift," this paper demonstrates how Season Five transforms the apparent death wish into a meditation on meaningful sacrifice. Rather than representing psychological defeat, Buffy's final act emerges from her recognition that "death is your gift"—a reframing that positions her sacrifice as the culmination of her identity as protector rather than its negation. The season's treatment of violence and mortality reveals how the series uses supernatural metaphors to explore fundamental questions about authentic existence and the meaning of heroic action.</p></div>

                <h3>Souls, Chips, and Moral Agency: Deconstructing Essentialism in Buffyverse Ethics</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>This paper examines the complex and often contradictory treatment of moral agency in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, arguing that rather than evolving from essentialist to constructivist ethics, the series maintains productive tensions between competing moral frameworks. Through detailed analysis of character arcs—particularly Spike's chip-induced moral development, Anya's gradual integration into human moral frameworks, and Faith's tragic moral collapse—this study demonstrates how the show uses supernatural metaphors to explore fundamental questions about the sources of moral capacity. The series' inconsistent treatment of souls as both material objects and aspects of consciousness reflects deeper philosophical uncertainties about moral agency, ultimately suggesting that moral capacity emerges through complex interactions between external constraints, personal choice, and community integration rather than essential metaphysical properties alone. Rather than resolving these tensions, Buffy the Vampire Slayer's sophisticated moral universe deliberately maintains them as ongoing sources of dramatic and philosophical complexity.</p></div>

                <h3>The Mayor as Theological Figure: Faith, Belief, and Divine Love in Season 3</h3>
                <div class="abstract"><p>This paper examines the relationship between Mayor Richard Wilkins III and Faith Lehane in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 3, arguing that Faith functions as literal "faith" whose genuine belief enables the Mayor's transformation from politician to theological authority figure. While the Mayor employs Christian moral language and family values rhetoric, his love for Faith follows Old Testament patterns of conditional divine favor rather than unconditional parental affection. Through close analysis of key episodes, particularly "Bad Girls" and "Consequences," this study demonstrates how Faith's approach to the Mayor represents a conscious choice to seek divine authority after her individualistic philosophy fails. The Mayor's consistent moral rhetoric within his relationship with Faith, combined with his demand for absolute devotion, positions him as a complex theological entity who appropriates Christian forms for divine rather than human purposes. By comparing this dynamic to the evolving Giles-Buffy relationship, this analysis reveals how both represent chosen family structures operating according to fundamentally different principles—human love that evolves toward unconditional support versus divine love that remains eternally contingent upon worship and obedience.</p></div>
