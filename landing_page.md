# Slayerfest '03: The Academic Symposium on Buffy Studies

## In every generation there is a conference.

**May 16-18, 2003 | University of California, Sunnydale, CA**

## About Slayerfest '03

For seven seasons, _Buffy_ has offered more than monster-of-the-week entertainment. It has staged fundamental questions about existential responsibility, the construction of feminine heroism, and the unconscious forces that shape identity and desire. This conference celebrated a series that transformed the teenage girl from object of the gaze into philosophical subject—one who confronts death, choice, and the burden of consciousness with remarkable sophistication.

The work of interpretation has only begun. Slayerfest '03 established a foundation for what we hope will become an ongoing tradition of serious philosophical and psychoanalytic engagement with popular culture that refuses to condescend to its subject matter.

Thank you to all presenters, reviewers, and attendees who made this gathering possible. The Slayer may have wielded the stake, but we're armed with Nietzsche, Freud, and Wittgenstein.

_"The hardest thing in this world is to live in it."_ — Buffy Summers
