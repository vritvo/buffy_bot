# Slayerfest '03: The Academic Symposium on Buffy Studies

## In every generation there is a conference.

**May 16-18, 2003 | University of California, Sunnydale, CA**

## About Slayerfest '03

For seven seasons, _Buffy_ has offered more than monster-of-the-week entertainment. It has staged fundamental questions about existential responsibility, the construction of feminine heroism, and the unconscious forces that shape identity and desire. Slayerfest '03 brought together leading scholars to interrogate these themes with the seriousness they deserve.

Yet the work of interpretation has only begun. Through philosophy, psychoanalysis, and feminist theory, this inaugural gathering established a foundation for a tradition of analysis that refuses to condescend to its subject matter. Even as the end of the world remains a recurring threat, our scholarship is structured to endure it.

The papers archived here represent the best of that work: rigorously reviewed, carefully revised, and ultimately accepted into the official proceedings. We extend sincere gratitude to all presenters, reviewers, administrative procedures, and ~~unseen labor~~ that made this conference possible.
